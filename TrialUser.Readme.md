# Trial user configuration
AFC has the capability to provide for trial users that have limited ability to perform spectrum availability requests in preset configuration.

### Create a user with the trial role only
The new user can register for account online via the UI.  Upon approval, the user is granted by default the Trial role, and can run start sending inquiries.

### Running the Spectrum query as the Trial user
The trial user can simply provide **TestCertificationId** as the certification ID and **TestSerialNumber** as the serial number in the Spectrum query.
