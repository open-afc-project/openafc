## Databases <a name="databases">

ALS (AFC Log Storage) functionality revolves around two PostgreSQL databases, used for log storage: **ALS** and **AFC_LOGS**.

### *ALS* Database <a name="als_database">

Stores log of AFC Request/Response/Config data. Has rather convoluted multitable structure.

SQL code for creation of this database contained in *ALS.sql* file. This file should be considered generated and not be manually edited.

*als_db_schema* folder contains source material for *ALS.sql* generation:

- *ALS.dbml*. Source file for [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io) DB diagramming site. Copy/paste content of this file there, make modifications, then copy/paste back to this file.  
  Also upon completion *ALS_raw.sql* and *ALS.png* should be exported (as *Export to PostgreSQL* and *Export to PNG* respectively) - see below.

- *ALS_raw.sql*. Database creation SQL script that should exported from [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io) after changes made to *ALS.dbml*.  
  This file is almost like final *ALS.sql*, but requires certain tweaks:
    * Declaring used PostgreSQL extensions (PostGIS in this case)
    * Removal of many-to-many artifacts. For many-to-many relationships [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io) creates artificial tables that are, adding insult to injury, violate PostgreSQL syntax. They are not used and should be removed.
    * Segmentation. Database is planned with segmentation in mind (by *month_idx* field). But segmentation itself not performed. This will need to be done eventually.

- *als_rectifier.awk* AWK script for converting *ALS_raw.sql* to *ALS.sql*.

- *ALS.png* Picturesque database schema. Should be exported as PNG after changes, made to *ALS.dbml*.

### *AFC_LOGS* Database <a name="als_logs_database">

For each JSON log type (*topic* on Kafka parlance) this database has separate table with following columns:

- *time* Log record timetag with timezone

- *source* String that uniquely identifies entity that created log record

- *log* JSON log record.

### Initial Database <a name="initial_database">

To create database `als_siphon.py` script should connect to already database. This already existing database named *initial database*, by default it is built-in database named *postgres*.

### Template Databases <a name="template_database">

Template databases, used for creation of *ALS* and *AFC_LOGS* databases. Something other than default might be used (but not yet, as of time of this writing).


## `als_siphon.py` - Moving Logs From Kafka To Postgres <a name="als_siphon_py">

The main purpose of `als_siphon.py` is to fetch log records from Kafka and move them to previously described PostgreSQL databases. Also it can initialize those databases.

`$ als_siphon.py COMMAND PARAMETERS`

Commands are:

- `init` Create *ALS* and/or *AFC_LOGS* database. If already exists, databases may be recreated or left intact.

- `siphon` Do the moving from Kafka to PostgreSQL.

- `init_siphon` First create databases then do the siphoning. Used for Docker operation.

Parameters are many - see help messages.


## `als_query.py` - Querying Logs From Postgres Database <a name="als_query_py">

This script queries logs, stored in *ALS* and *AFC_LOGS* databases.

As of time of this writing this script only supports `log` command that reads JSON logs from *AFC_LOGS*


### Installation <a name="als_query_install">

`als_query.py` requires Python 3 with reasonably recent *sqlalchemy*, *psycopg2*, *geoalchemy2* modules installed (latter is optional - not required for e.g. `log` command). 

Proper installation of these modules requires too much luck to be described here (as even `venv/virtualenv` does not help always - only sometimes). If you'll succeed - fine, otherwise there is one more method: running from the container where `als_siphon.py` installed. In latter case invocation looks like this:

`$ docker exec SIPHON_CONTAINER als_query.py CMD ...`

Here `SIPHON_CONTAINER` is either value from first column of `docker ps` or from last column of `docker-compose ps`.

### Addressing PostgreSQL Server <a name="als_query_server">

Another important aspect is how to access PostgreSQL database server where logs were placed.

#### Explicit specification

Using `--server` (aka `-s`) and `--password` parameters of `als_query.py` command line). Here are most probable cases:

1. `als_query.py` runs inside `als_siphon.py` container, PostgreSQL runs inside the container, named `bulk_postgres` in *docker-compose.yaml* (that's how it is named as of time of this writing):  
  `$ docker exec SIPHON_CONTAINER als_query.py CMD \ `  
  `--server [USER@]als_postrgres[:PORT][?OPTIONS] [--password PASSWORD] ...`  
  Here `USER` or `PORT` might be omitted if they are `postgres` and `5432` respectively. `--password PASSWORD` and `OPTIONS` are optional.   
  Actually, in this case `--server` and `--password` may be omitted - see below on the use of environment variables.

2. User/host/port of PostgreSQL server is known:  
  `$ [docker exec SIPHON_CONTAINER] als_query CMD \ `  
  `--server [USER@]HOST[:PORT][?OPTIONS] [--password PASSWORD] ...`  

3. `als_query.py` runs outside container, PostgreSQL runs inside container:  
  `$ als_query.py CMD \ `  
  `--server [USER@]^POSTGRES_CONTAINER[:PORT][?OPTIONS] \ `  
  `[--password PASSWORD] ...`  
  Note the `***^***` before `POSTGRES_CONTAINER`. Here, again `POSTGRES_CONTAINER` is either value from first column of `docker ps` or from last column of `docker-compose ps` for container running PostgreSQL

I expect #1 to be the common case for development environment, #2 - for deployment environment, #3 - for illustrations (for sake of brevity) or for some lucky conditions.

#### Environment variables

If `--server` parameter not specified `als_query.py` attempts to use environment variables:

- `POSTGRES_LOG_USER`, `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_LOG_PASSWORD` for accessing *AFC_LOGS* database
- `POSTGRES_ALS_USER`, `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_ALS_PASSWORD` for accessing *ALS* database

These environment variables are passed to container with `als_siphon.py`, so they are quite natural choice when running `als_query` from there (case #1 above). 

Hence for case #1 `als_query.py` command line would actually look like this:  
`$ docker exec SIPHON_CONTAINER als_query.py CMD ...`  
Where `...` does not contain `--server`


### `log` Command <a name="als_query_log">

`log` command retrieves JSON logs from *AFC_LOGS* database. Each JSON logs is belongs to certain *topic* (handy term, originated from Kafka). Topic is a string (***lowercase highly recommended, 'ALS' name must not be used***) that supposedly corresponds to format (content) of JSON data.

Topic specifies a name of table inside *AFC_LOGS* database.

Since content of JSON may be any and PostgreSQL already provides the special 'SELECT' syntax for accessing JSON data (see e.g. [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-json/) and [here](https://www.javatpoint.com/postgresql-json), google for further assistance), `log` command is, in fact, thin wrapper around `SELECT` command, plus a couple of additional options.

Each table in *AFC_LOGS* has the following columns (this is important when composing `SELECT` statements):

|Column|Content|
|------|-------|
|time|Time when log record was made in (includes date, time, timezone)|
|source|Entity (e.g. WEB server) that made record|
|log|JSON log data|

Command format:  
`$ [docker exec SIPHON_CONTAINER] als_query.py log OPTIONS [SELECT_BODY]`

|Parameter|Meaning|
|---------|-------|
|--server/-s **[USER@][^]HOST_OR_CONTAINER[:PORT][?OPTIONS]**|PostgreSQL server connection parameters. See discussion in [Installing and running](#als_query_deploy) chapter. This parameter is mandatory|
|--password **PASSWORD**|PostgreSQL connection password (if required)|
|--topics|List existing topics (database tables)|
|--sources **[TOPIC]**|List sources - all or from specific topic|
|--format/-f **{bare\|json\|csv}**|Output format for SELECT-based queries: **bare** - unadorned single column output, **csv** - output as CSV table (default), **json** - output as JSON list or row dictionaries|
|**SELECT_BODY**|SQL SELECT statement body (without leading `SELECT` and trailing `;`. May be unquoted, but most likely requires quotes because of special symbols like `*`, `>`, etc.|

#### `log` Command Examples <a name="als_query_log_examples">

Suppose that:

- There are various topics (tables), among which there is topic *few* (let me remind again, that lowercase topic names are recommended), filled with JSONs with structure similar to this:  
```
{
    "a": 42,
    "b": [1, 2, 3],
    "c": {"d": 57}
}
```

- `als_query.py` runs in `regression_als_siphon_1` container (YMMV - see output of `docker-compose ps`). In this case there is no need to pass `--server` parameter, as it will be taken from environment variables.

Now, here are some possible actions:

- List all topics:  
  `$ docker exec regression_als_siphon_1 als_query.py log --topics`  
  Note that there is no `--server` parameter here, as `als_query.py` would values, passed over environment variables.

- Print content of *foo* topic (table) in its entirety, using CSV format:  
  `$ docker exec regression_als_siphon_1 als_query.py log "* from foo"`  
  This invokes `SELECT * from foo;` on *AFC_LOGS* database of PostgreSQL server.

- Print key names of JSONs of topic *foo*:  
  `$ docker exec regression_als_siphon_1 als_query.py log \ `  
  `json_object_keys(log) from foo`  
  Note that quotes may be omitted here, as there are no special symbols in select statement.

- From topic *foo* print values of *c.d* for all records, using bare (unadorned) format:   
  `$ docker exec regression_als_siphon_1 als_query.py log \ `  
  `-f bare "log->'c'->'d' from foo"`  
  Note the quotes around field names

- From topic *foo* print only values of *b[0]* for all records where *a* field equals *179*:  
  `$ docker exec regression_als_siphon_1 als_query.py log \ `  
  `"log->'b'->0 from foo where log->'a' = 179"`  
  Note the way list indexing is performed (`->0`).

- Print maximum value of column *a* in topic *foo*:  
  `$ docker exec regression_als_siphon_1 als_query.py log "MAX(log->'a') from foo"`  

- Print log records in given time range:  
  `$ docker exec regression_als_siphon_1 als_query.py log \ `  
  `"* from foo where time > '2023-02-08 23:25:54.484174+00:00'" \ `  
  `"and time < '2023-02-08 23:28:54.484174+00:00'"`
